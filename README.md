# Tech Quiz Suite

## Description

Starter code provided a fully functional Tech Quiz app to test knowledge and improve skills as a coder.
The goal of this homework is for me to learn how to enhance an application by adding Cypress for component and end-to-end tests.
This is a full stack MERN application.
